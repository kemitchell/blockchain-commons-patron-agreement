**Blockchain Commons** and **Company** agree:

# Background

- _Blockchain Commons_ is TODO

# Work

_Blockchain Commons_ will do the work described in each **Statement of Work** cosigned with _Company_ under this agreement. _Company_ will pay the fees and expenses described in the _Statement of Work_. _Blockchain Commons_ will bill _Company_ for fees and expenses as described in the _Statement of Work_.

# Representative

_Company_ agrees to appoint a **Technical Representative** by giving _Notice_ of their name, title, and email address before work starts. _Company_ agrees to appoint a replacement _Technical Representative_ if the current one leaves or becomes unavailable. If _Company_ or any _Affiliate_ has technical staff, the _Technical Representative_ must be a member of the technical staff.

# Responsiveness

TODO

# Payment

## Deadline

_Company_ will pay each correctly billed amount within `payment deadline` of receiving the bill.

## Errors

_Company_ will notify _Blockchain Commons_ by e-mail of any suspected error in a bill within `bill dispute deadline` of receiving the bill. If _Company_ does not notify of an error in that time, _Company_ will pay the billed amount.

## Late Payments

_Company_ will pay _Blockchain Commons_ `late payment interest` interest on late bill payments, compounded monthly. If the law sets a lower maximum rate of late-payment interest, _Company_ will pay that rate instead.

## Stopping Work

If _Company_ does not pay a bill on time, _Blockchain Commons_ may notify _Company_ by e-mail and stop work until all bills are paid. Stopping work in this way postpones all deadlines under this agreement for as long as work stops. Any recurring fees continue to add up.

## Cost of Collection

If _Company_ does not pay a bill on time, _Company_ agrees to pay _Blockchain Commons_' costs of pursuing payment and collecting that bill, such as attorney fees and costs, that _Blockchain Commons_ incurs after the deadline for payment.

- the fact that _Company_ is _Blockchain Commons_' client for work on any _Statement of Work_

- information about any _Company_ product or service that _Utilizes_ or motivates any _Statement of Work_

- information about the _Software_, services, systems, and other tools that _Company_ uses

## Keeping Secrets

With the exceptions in [Work with Open Software Communities](#work-with-open-software-communities), unless compelled by a _Legal Requirement_, _Company_ and _Blockchain Commons_ agree not to:

- disclose each other's _Secrets_ to anyone

- use each other's _Secrets_ for any purpose but work under a _Statement of Work_

- use or disclose each other's _Secrets_ in violation of any _Legal Requirement_

- help others disclose or use each other's _Secrets_ in these ways

### Collaborating with Open Software Developers

In specific circumstances, _Blockchain Commons_ may disclose _Company_ _Secrets_ to developers of _Open Software_:

- _Blockchain Commons_ may only disclose _Company_ _Secrets_ of a technical nature.
