**Blockchain Commons** and **Company** agree:

# Background

- _Blockchain Commons_ is TODO

# Work

_Blockchain Commons_ will do the work described in each **Statement of Work** cosigned with _Company_ under this agreement. _Company_ will pay the fees and expenses described in the _Statement of Work_. _Blockchain Commons_ will bill _Company_ for fees and expenses as described in the _Statement of Work_.

# Representative

_Company_ agrees to appoint a **Primary Contact** by giving _Notice_ of their name, title, and email address before work starts. _Company_ agrees to appoint a replacement _Primary Contact_ if the current one leaves or becomes unavailable. If _Company_ or any _Affiliate_ has technical staff, the _Primary Contact_ must be a member of the technical staff.

# Payment

## Deadline

_Company_ will pay each correctly billed amount within `payment deadline` of receiving the bill.

## Errors

_Company_ will notify _Blockchain Commons_ by e-mail of any suspected error in a bill within `bill dispute deadline` of receiving the bill. If _Company_ does not notify of an error in that time, _Company_ will pay the billed amount.

## Late Payments

_Company_ will pay _Blockchain Commons_ `late payment interest` interest on late bill payments, compounded monthly. If the law sets a lower maximum rate of late-payment interest, _Company_ will pay that rate instead.

## Stopping Work

If _Company_ does not pay a bill on time, _Blockchain Commons_ may notify _Company_ by e-mail and stop work until all bills are paid. Stopping work in this way postpones all deadlines under this agreement for as long as work stops. Any recurring fees continue to add up.

## Cost of Collection

If _Company_ does not pay a bill on time, _Company_ agrees to pay _Blockchain Commons_' costs of pursuing payment and collecting that bill, such as attorney fees and costs, that _Blockchain Commons_ incurs after the deadline for payment.
