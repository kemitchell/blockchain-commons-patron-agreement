# Purpose

The parties anticipate disclosure of _Confidential Information_ by _Patron_ for the purpose of enabling _Blockchain Commons_ to render **Consulting Services** to _Patron_ under the parties' **Patronage Framework Agreement**.

# Confidential Information

## Categories of Confidential Information

Subject to [Exclusions from Confidential Information](#exclusions-from-confidential-information), **Confidential Information** means:

- information disclosed by _Patron_ during the term of this agreement that is, related to _Patron_'s business, necessary for _Blockchain Commons_' consulting work under the _Patronage Framework Agreement_, and either marked "confidential" or identified as confidential by written notice to _Blockchain Commons_ within fourteen calendar days of disclosure; and

- other information derived from these kinds of information.

## Exclusions from Confidential Information

### Public Information

Information that is now public is not _Confidential Information_.  _Confidential Information_ that becomes public, other than as a result of breach of this agreement, ceases to be _Confidential Information_.

### Otherwise Acquired Information

Information that _Blockchain Commons_ receives other than from _Patron_ is not _Confidential Information_, unless the disclosure breached a confidentiality obligation to _Patron_ that _Patron_ made known to _Blockchain Commons_.

### Independently Developed Information

Information _Blockchain Commons_ develops independently is not, or ceases to be, _Confidential Information_ of _Patron_.  _Blockchain Commons_ shall bear the burden of proving independent development using contemporaneous documentary evidence.

# Confidentiality Obligations

## Nondisclosure

Except as described in [Permitted Disclosure](#permitted-disclosure) or as required by law, _Blockchain Commons_ shall not disclose _Confidential Information_ to anyone.

## Permitted Disclosure

_Blockchain Commons_ may disclose _Confidential Information_ to the following personnel:

- employees, independent contractors, officers, directors, and agents of _Blockchain Commons_ (**Personnel**) who:

  - have a need to know the _Confidential Information_ to render _Consulting Services_; and

  -  have entered written confidentiality agreements with _Blockchain Commons_ that impose confidentiality obligations affording as much or more protection as those of this agreement that apply to the _Confidential Information_; and

- legal and financial advisers providing services to _Blockchain Commons_ under confidentiality obligations imposed by law or professional rules (**Advisers**).

## Limited Use

_Blockchain Commons_ shall use _Confidential Information_ only to render _Consulting Services_.

## Security Measures

_Blockchain Commons_ shall take measures to secure materials embodying _Confidential Information_ at least as protective as those _Blockchain Commons_ employs to secure its own _Confidential Information_, but in any event no less than reasonable measures.

## Preserve Proprietary Notices

_Blockchain Commons_ shall not remove any proprietary notices attached to materials embodying _Confidential Information_.

## No Illegal Dealing in Securities

_Blockchain Commons_ shall not break securities laws by purchasing, selling, or otherwise dealing in securities of _Patron_ on the basis of _Confidential Information_ that is material, nonpublic information.  _Blockchain Commons_ shall instruct anyone to whom it discloses _Confidential Information_ that may be material, nonpublic information not to break securities laws by dealing in securities of _Patron_.

## No Reverse Engineering

_Blockchain Commons_ shall not reverse engineer any material embodying _Confidential Information_.

## Mitigate Legally Required Disclosure

The following obligations apply when the law requires disclosure of _Confidential Information_ and when _Blockchain Commons_ reasonably expects that the law may require disclosure of _Confidential Information_:

### Give Notice of Required Disclosure

If legally permitted, _Blockchain Commons_ shall promptly notify _Patron_ of the nature of the requirement and the _Confidential Information_ affected.  If practical, _Blockchain Commons_ shall give notice quickly enough to afford _Patron_ practical chance to start a proceeding to protect the confidentiality of the _Confidential Information_.  On _Patron_ request, _Blockchain Commons_ shall cooperate with _Patron_ in any such proceeding by providing reasonable assistance.

###  Reimburse Expenses of Cooperation

_Patron_ shall reimburse _Blockchain Commons_'s reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of cooperating in any proceeding described in [Give Notice of Required Disclosure](#give-notice-of-required-disclosure).

## Give Notice of Leaks

_Blockchain Commons_ shall give _Patron_ notice when _Blockchain Commons_ becomes aware, suspects, or anticipates that _Confidential Information_ has been or will be disclosed or used in breach of this agreement.

## Return and Destruction

Subject to [Records Policy](#records-policy), when this agreement terminates, _Blockchain Commons_ shall promptly:

- return all materials embodying _Confidential Information_ that _Patron_ provided with request to return; and

- destroy all parts of other materials that embody _Confidential Information_.

## Records Policy

When this agreement terminates, if _Blockchain Commons_ has a written records retention policy for the creation and scheduled destruction of archival or backup records, and only specialized personnel can routinely access those records, then _Blockchain Commons_ may retain materials embodying _Confidential Information_ until destroyed under that policy.

## Comply with Export Controls

Both parties shall comply with export and reexport laws with respect to _Confidential Information_.

## Compliance and Oversight

- _Blockchain Commons_ shall ensure that its _Advisers_ abide by the confidentiality obligations of _Blockchain Commons_ under this agreement.

- _Blockchain Commons_ shall also ensure that its _Personnel_ abide by the confidentiality obligations of _Blockchain Commons_ under this agreement.

- _Blockchain Commons_ shall provide _Patron_ copies of confidentiality agreements with _Personnel_ who receive _Confidential Information_ on _Patron_ request.

- Breach of _Blockchain Commons_ obligations by _Blockchain Commons_ _Personnel_ or _Blockchain Commons_ _Advisers_ will be deemed breach of this agreement by _Blockchain Commons_ itself.
